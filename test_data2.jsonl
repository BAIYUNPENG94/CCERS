If this keeps going, Ziqiao’s gonna turn greener than a broccoli field.\nYiFei: (still in the mood to nitpick) You mean broccoli, right? Rapeseed flowers are yellow.\nZeng Xiaoxian: (super flustered) Okay, I meant broccoli—wait, no! I meant Ziqiao!\nYiFei: (instantly comparing) No way, Ziqiao's pretty cool. If my little bro were half as good as him, I’d be worry-free.\nZeng Xiaoxian: (pulls a bowl brush from the jar and waves it in front of YiFei) Hmph, no matter how strong you are, there's always someone stronger. One red apricot is breaking out of the wall!"

Wake up.\nYiFei: (groggy, whiny with a sobbing tone) It’s burning! Burning hot!\nZeng Xiaoxian: (blows on it helplessly) It hasn’t even touched you yet.\nYiFei: (pouting) I don’t want porridge. I want ice cream.\nZeng Xiaoxian: (like coaxing a child) No way. Be good. You're sick, you can’t eat ice cream.\nYiFei: (whining) But my throat hurts~\nZeng Xiaoxian: (insists) Then you definitely can’t have it.\nYiFei: (pouting) You don’t care about me.\nZeng Xiaoxian: (innocently) Even if I care, you still can’t eat it."
